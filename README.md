A project to create a Raspberry Pi (or maybe Chip) powered alarm clock that can play streaming audio and generate white/brown noise for masking sounds. This project will also pull in the sunrise simulating LED light alarm from sunrisealarm. Will feature a web frontend for control and display.

Lots of learning to do :)
